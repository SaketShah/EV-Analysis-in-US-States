# Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Analysis in the US

## Overview
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV), Hybrid (HEV), and Alternative Fuel Vehicle adoption trends across the United States. Using **Python** and **Pandas**, the notebook processes state-level vehicle registration data to calculate market shares, identify leaders and laggards in green transportation, and compare traditional gasoline usage against emerging fuel technologies.

## Project Structure
* **`EV_Analysis.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data cleaning, processing, and analysis code.
* **`Vehicle Data.csv`**: The dataset used for analysis (ensure this file is present in your working directory).

## Dependencies
To run this project, you will need Python installed along with the following libraries:

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
  
## Sample Insights

Based on the analysis of vehicle registration data, the following trends were observed:

* **Regional Leadership:** States like **California**, **Washington**, **Hawaii**, and **D.C.** are currently leading the nation in EV adoption and are natural priorities for charging infrastructure expansion.
* **Alternative Fuels:** While EVs are growing, **Ethanol/Flex-fuel (E85)** remains the most broadly used alternative fuel, accounting for over **20 million vehicles (~7%)** nationwide.
* **Growth Opportunities:** Large states like **Texas** and **Florida** have lower percentage adoption rates but represent high-impact growth markets due to their massive total vehicle volume.
* **Niche Markets:** Technologies like **Hydrogen** and **Propane** remain niche, suggesting they require targeted rather than broad national infrastructure investments.
